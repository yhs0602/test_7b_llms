   In the lush and verdant meadow,
   Where the sunbeams gently lay,
   Strode a pig, so jolly and plump,
   With a snout that snuffled and swayed.

   On its back, a blanket of straw,
   Around its neck, a ribbon tied,
   A cheerful demeanor it bore,
   A mirthful smile, bright in its eyes.

   Through the tall grass and flowers it plodded,
   A contented 'oink' it would emit,
   Dancing, playing by the morning light,
   Free from all cares, a happy sight.

   With friends near and far, both swine and fowl,
   A fellowship of animals so free,
   In this great wide world, it felt at home,
   Where love and laughter could run free.

   So in the meadow, where the flowers bloom,
   And the sun sets with colors a-glow,
   There's a pig, with its friends so content,
   Living a life that it shares, wherever it goes.
